# Shutdown

The easiest way to shutdown your game without worry.

Shutdown's goal is simple: shutdown your old servers and get players back into new ones ASAP.
No reconnect buttons, no waiting around, it just worksâ„¢.

# How

Shutdown functions by having two types of places:
- Normal places
  - These contain the typical content for your game, like the map and game logic
- Migration place
  - A single place which contains as little content as possible

When a normal place's servers shut down, players are teleported to the migration place.
After a configurable amount of time passes, they are teleported back to a configurable normal place.

For configuration options, see the [Usage](#usage) section.

# Installation

There are a couple of ways to install Shutdown:
